Patient Information Database System
Hospitals require pertinent patient data in order to provide the best possible care. One approach to collect all of this data is to construct a database that not only stores previous medical records but also stores data when a new patient enters. This can be extremely beneficial to healthcare professionals and hospital administrators when it comes to treating patients.

This Patient Information Database System is a database management system designed to manage patient information at a hospital. It allows healthcare practitioners to keep track of patient information that can be referred to when the need arises, as it can be utilized for a variety of purposes. Along with the old medical records, the system includes information about doctors, diseases, medications, and equipment.

Objectives & Goals
The following are the objectives and goals of the Patient Information Database System:

Having these medical records, the hospital can respond promptly in treating and alerting patients during public health crises.
The reports generated through medical records can be shared with medicine manufacturing companies to justify the demand (patient personal details will not be shared here).
Based on the current data, we can obtain the average time required to treat a patient and predict the outcome for the future.
A report will be provided to the government for the doctor scarcity in a particular specialization.
Based on the data, we can predict the frequent diseases that are affecting different age groups and act accordingly and share the information with NGOs and various organizations.
Medical records that are saved can be shared with the government and various charities so that patients may have a high chance of getting financial aid 
We can take precautionary measures by identifying seasonal diseases in people.
